# GenAI Recommendations System

This project demonstrates the generation of customer data and their inquiries using the Faker library. The generated data is then used to create a recommendation system using ChromaDB and LangChain.

## Files

- `GenAI_Recommendations.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code to generate customer data and build the recommendation system.
- `products_info.csv`: CSV file containing the generated customer data.

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install faker pandas numpy chromadb langchain langchain-community langchain-core transformers sentence-transformers bitsandbytes accelerate streamlit openai
    ```

2. Open the `GenAI_Recommendations.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage

1. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to generate the customer data and build the recommendation system.
2. The generated data will be saved in the `products_info.csv` file.
